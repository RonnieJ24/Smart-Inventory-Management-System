# Smart Inventory Management System

## Overview
The Smart Inventory Management System is a Python-based application developed for a mid-sized retail business. It efficiently handles, updates, and analyzes a diverse range of products, maintaining real-time inventory levels and providing predictive insights for stock replenishment. The system demonstrates the practical application of various data structures and algorithms, including hash tables, quicksort, graph algorithms, binary search trees, and efficiency analysis methods.

## Features
- **Inventory Lookup:** Utilizes hash tables for O(1) time complexity in product information retrieval.
- **Inventory Sorting:** Implements the Quicksort algorithm, demonstrating the divide-and-conquer approach for efficient sorting based on various product attributes.
- **Warehouse Layout Optimization:** Employs graph algorithms to optimize the product retrieval and storage process within the warehouse layout.
- **Binary Search Tree Placeholder:** Uses a simplified binary search tree as a placeholder for Red-Black Trees (RB-Trees) to organize and access inventory data.
- **Algorithm Efficiency Analysis:** Includes a basic profiling method to measure and report the execution time of operations, aiding in continuous performance optimization.
